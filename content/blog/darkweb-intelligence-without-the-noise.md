## Cut through leak chatter
We score and de-dupe breach posts, leaked credential dumps, and ransomware claims so you only see items mapped to your domains, brands, and executives.

## Action-first context
Each alert ships with adversary intel, source screenshots, and next steps your SOC can run immediately—no hunting through dashboards required.

## Less false positives
Correlation with exposed assets, current CVEs, and attack surface telemetry keeps distractions low and focuses teams on threats that can move the needle.
