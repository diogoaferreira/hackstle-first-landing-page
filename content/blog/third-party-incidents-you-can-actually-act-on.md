## Follow the blast radius
When a supplier is breached, Hackstle traces credential reuse, shared access, and brand mentions to see if attackers are pivoting toward you.

## Automate the response
Integrations trigger resets, takedowns, or ticketing workflows so you can contain exposure before it reaches your environment.

## Clear reporting for stakeholders
Concise digests and evidence packets make it easy to brief leadership without exporting charts from multiple dashboards.
